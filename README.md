        // Use these to point specific messages from the conversation
        id: 'what',
        // This is the content of the message to be displayed
        value: 'React Monkey is a tiny project for building Dialog-Tree chat appliactions.',
        // You can point to another message to break text down into smaller chunks
        chain: 'monkeyIsland',
        // This is the repleis that will be avilable to the user
        replies: [
            {
                value: "Why would I need that?",
                next: "why"
            },
            {
                value: "Ah, finally!",
                next: "finally"
            }
        ]
